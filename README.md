1. Download your prefered release from the releases section of this repository.
2. Create a directory and move the jar file into it.
3. Create a directory named `qdata` inside of the directory you just created.
4. Launch the game by running `java -jar qme.jar`.

If you are not using the latest version of Java runtime (15) then QME will not work. Please install it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
