### How to install QME like a weird person

If your operating system is not supported or you just want to make things hard then you can manually install QME. To do this follow these steps:

1. Download your prefered release from the releases section of this repository.
2. Create a directory and move the jar file into it.
3. Create a directory named `qdata` inside of the directory you just created.
4. Launch the game by running `java -jar qme.jar`.

If you are not using the latest version of Java runtime then QME will not work.
